# 🤖 Chatbot Using RNN

A context-aware chatbot capable of answering questions based on a given story, built with **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  
This project was developed as part of the **Google Developer Student Club (GDSC), IIT Kanpur** initiative (Dec 2023 – Jan 2024).

## 📌 Features
- Story-based **question answering chatbot**
- Implements **RNN** for sequential text processing  
- **NLP preprocessing**: tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, sentiment analysis, and text categorization  
- Built using **Keras** deep learning library  
- Achieved **87.8% training accuracy** and **83.1% validation accuracy**  
- Tested on **real-world conversational datasets** for robustness

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Text cleaning (stopword removal, tokenization)  
   - POS tagging & sentiment analysis  
   - Conversion to numerical sequences  

2. **Model Development**  
   - Implemented an RNN with Keras  
   - Trained using **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**  
   - Tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy  

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Training Accuracy: **87.8%**  
   - Validation Accuracy: **83.1%**  

4. **Deployment**  
   - Tested chatbot with story-based conversational queries  
   - Ensured accuracy and consistency in responses
